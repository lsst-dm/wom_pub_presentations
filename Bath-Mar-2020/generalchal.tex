%Should lSST e the las t?
\item Networks and infrastructure are improving but more needs to be done
\item Who looks after all the data ?

\begin{itemize}
\item For space science in Europe ESAC preserves data - it is relatively small
\item IPAC,  HEASARC and STScI  pretty much deal with NASA data - still not one location.
\item Who looks after all the ground based data ?
\item There is no long term preservation plan for LSST or other big telescopes in the USA (Alex wil probably have more to say on this)
\end{itemize}
%(LSST spent 10s of millions on netowrks)
\end{itemize}
