\frame {\frametitle{  Requirements Management }
\begin{itemize}
  \item Some requirements at an appropriate level are very useful
    \begin{itemize}
        {\color{red}
      \item Could have been better formulated
    \item Separation of performance, software and science requirements should have been clearer}
  \end{itemize}
\item DPAC stayed away from requirements tools like DOORS though
\item Used macros in LaTex for requirements and scripts to build trace tables
\item All requirements and test reports then ingested in the Information Management Tool \citellp{2012SPIE.8449E..0GC}
\item {\color{red} Could probably have put more effort in this earlier} - in ESAC now we have project for this
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Then we might have decided to start up some CUs later
  \end{itemize}
\item Reviews are an unavoidable part of all this in the agency
  \begin{itemize}
    \item ESA reviews are {\color{blue} too formal and too large}
    \item External reviewers like Innocente (\citell{LL:VI-001},\citell{LL:VI-002}) {\color{green}
    very good}
    \item Rubin - {\color{red} NSF and DOE plus AURA directors ..} not as structured .. careful what one wishes for..
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\frame {\frametitle{  Management and  science }
All large projects, especially science projects, have management {\em issues}
\begin{itemize}
  \item In 2006 we had a big management training week for the DPAC management --- though skeptically
    to start most found it good
  \item Science project management is a little different but still books like
    \citep{handy1993understanding} are quite useful
   \item {\color{red} Interface control between software was insufficient } --- data model was not enough
   \item Perhaps ESA should have taken control of all critical software
   \item Again on Rubin we have financial control over 75\% of construction - Comers team still out there. Financially control helpless - still issues

\begin{itemize}
\item  Under perfuming teams - literally working against each other from within
\item Poor definition of roles and responsibility's
\item Lack of decision making and following (i.e. lack of buy in  AND responsibility's taking}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
}

\frame {\frametitle{  Management and  science - Agile }
  Cyclic (Agile type) development seems well suited to science
    \begin{itemize}
      \item We chose six month cycles --- probably too long
\item Rubin DM  adds  3 month review and tighter internal planning (like ESAC in DPAC)
      \item {\color{green} Some prototypes started real early} \citep{1999BaltA...8...57O}
      \item We have great simulations --- they started in 1998 before Gaia was accepted
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Still they always seemed to be a little behind what people wanted --- {\color{blue} we
          have no solution for that, could not start earlier}
          \item Simulator fell out of the ECSS rig our --- testing etc\ldots
        \end{itemize}
      \item We did a lot of testing; {\color{blue} some tests were probably not appropriate in hindsight}
      \item {\color{red} Despite aiming for test driven development in DPAC --- NOT ENOUGH effort in
      testing and many systems only got continuous integration years into the project}
    \end{itemize}
