Have a code of conduct.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Internal
    \begin{itemize}
	    \item Data Management Leadership meeting every Monday (30 minutes) - 4 times a year longer 2.5 days (2 now virtual with moderators and 5 hour days to match time zones).
             \item Gaia DPAC executive similar (2 times physical meeting per year) - technical focus.
	    \item Both Rubin and DPAC have {\color{green} newsletters } excellent and (DPAC) well contributed to
      \item (Few) Focused working groups and working meetings
      \item DPAC First consortium meeting Nov 2015; {\color{red} 10 years perhaps late .}
      \item Rubin have one every year {\color{red} it seems too much}
      \item Though stressful personally {\color{green} Rubin putting all software under one leader is good } - {\color{red} Done rather late } hence stress .
      \item As for any project cost of entry for new people is very high {\color{blue} --- no obvious
      solution }
    \end{itemize}
  \item ESA policy initially to reduce contact between DPAC and Astrium ( now AirbusDS who constructed Gaia)
    {\color{red} not good}
  \item External
    \begin{itemize}
	    \item Perhaps could have had a better DPAC website - Rubin is somewhat ok .. {\color{blue} would really like a git backed Pull Request driven site .. but we have Drupal..}
      \item ESA PR also not great (ok as they point out they have a tiny fraction of NASA budget)
	  \item A bit better on Rubin (also fraction of NASA budget).
      \item {\color{blue}DPAC Publication policy was dealt with very late }
      \item {\color{green}Publication policy clearly in place on Rubin }
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
