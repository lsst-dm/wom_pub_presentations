\frame{\frametitle{Roles, DM products and owners }
\begin{itemize}
\item Roles of individuals and groups unclear
\item The products of DM are not clearly listed - these are not the Data Products  \citeds{LSE-163}
\item Product Owner is not clear in all cases and retrospectives are not held.
\item Issues :
\begin{itemize}
 \item priorities are not clear nor who sets them nor who decides
 \item lock up or misdirected effort
\end{itemize}
\item Ideas : (now implemented in \citeds{LDM-294}
\begin{itemize}
\item Clarify roles in DM
\item Identify products in a product tree  (see back wall of plenary room)
\item Identify product owners - which may not always be a scientist nor in the same unit - e.g widgets are produced in SUIT but the sometimes used for building Quality Tools, the product owner of some of those widgets are probably not in SUIT.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\frame{\frametitle{ Test, Integration,  V\& V }
\begin{itemize}
\item Not a clear plan for Integration, Verification and Validation
\item No current plan for Operations Rehearsals to validate the operational system
\item Issues :
\begin{itemize}
	\item there is a WP in SQuaRE but discussions on what validation is seem to have {\em locked} this up
	\item risk not supporting commissioning effectively by having unstable systems
\end{itemize}
\item Ideas :
\begin{itemize}
	\item \citeyearpar{LDM-503} defines the full Verification \& Validation plan and define responsibilities for all the parts
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Pinning down scope is difficult in science algorithms - this is more investigation. Infrastructure scope less so.\\

\frame{\frametitle{ Scope not always clear  }
\begin{itemize}
	\item As normal especially for science projects requirements have degree of {\em interpretation}
	\item Similarly project guidelines may be interpreted
\item Issues :
\begin{itemize}
	\item some extra scope taken on and not properly agreed how to pay for it
	\item too much risk {\em factored in} to some WBS
	\item scope of some modules completely unclear (lack of product owner(s))
\end{itemize}
\item Ideas :
\begin{itemize}
	\item  calculate contingency on risk - LSST approach
	\item prioritize requirements so we know where to deploy effort
	\item Use short lived working groups to pin down specific topics (SuperTask WG).
	\item Visit sites and really understand what they are doing
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\frame{\frametitle{Configuration Control}
\begin{itemize}
\item Everyone seems to build all the software packages
\item Some effort put into conda releases but was not working out - EUPS works
\item Issues :
\begin{itemize}
	\item lack of  stability in the code base - build all the only way to make changes
	\item despite having a CCB (called TCT)  changes can be disruptive
	\item no one {\em owns } code modules
\end{itemize}
\item Ideas :
\begin{itemize}
	\item Introduce the traditional configuration manager role
	\item get dependencies under control
	\item have stable releases toward end of cycle - provide bug fixes on demand for  at least the last  release
	\item (re)introduce module custodians
	\item {\color{red} No other way to support an operational system.}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\frame{\frametitle{ Other Risks/Opportunities }

\begin{itemize}
\item Transparency of leadership (or the lack thereof)
\item Scope of Chilean DAC  -  now in draft form
\item Prioritization and scope in general needs to be looked at (addressed in Replan and new version of \citeds{LSE-61}
\item Galaxy multifit for dark energy - could/should be done later.
\item Parallelisation of code in C++ is hard - but needed for LSST
\item Keeping all old releases on disk  to be costed ( has been costed, not really accepted for ops)
\item Keeping all data on disk instead of tape to be costed (in progress)
\item Number of users for science platform and portal (5 * SDSS)
\item Qserv - need to confirm its a good choice - went to SLAC soon to understand this. Study with Microsoft pending
\end{itemize}
