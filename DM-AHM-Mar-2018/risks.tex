\section{Risks and Opportunities}

\frame{\frametitle{Realized Risks}

As part of the replan  three risks  were realized:

\begin{description}

  \item[DM-062]{Programming team productivity below estimate due to geographical distribution/competing priorities.}
  \item[DM-085]{SUI workload underestimated.}
  \item[DM-087]{SUI requirements change.}

\end{description}

These risks are being addressed in the new DM plan and the associated request to draw on contingency.\\
New management and organization allowed us to reduce exposure on some other risks. \\

This plus assessment of exposure on other risks reduced our risk exposure at the level of $\sim$\$12M (to $\sim$\$12M).

\begin{description}
\item[DM-018]{Computing power required for Data Release Production exceeds estimates
\begin{itemize}
	\item Lots of verification testing (e.g. HSC processing)
\end{itemize}
}

\item[DM-023]{Unanticipated characteristics of real data result in poor MultiFit performance (computational)
\begin{itemize}
	\item Lots of verification testing (e.g. HSC processing)
\end{itemize}
}

\item[DM-042]{Loss of key personnel
\begin{itemize}
    \item{Management structure reducing `single points of failure'}
    \item{Focus on written design documentation \& verification plans}
\end{itemize}
}

\item[DM-021]{ Object counts exceed expectations, leading to insufficient compute
\begin{itemize}
\item Improved modeling: work in progress (Juri\'c)
\end{itemize}
}

\item[DM-032]{LSST DM hardware architecture becomes antiquated
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Core algorithmic code is flexible and hardware-agnostic}
    \item{Actively tracking and anticipating the state of the art}
\end{itemize}
}
\end{description}
