\begin{itemize}
\item The Network Engineering Team completed the first successful transfer of digital data over LSST/AURA fiber optic networks from the Summit Site on Cerro Pachon to the Base Site in La Serena and on to the Archive Site at NCSA in Champaign. A set of 6 x 10 Gbps Network Interface cards on Data Transfer Nodes (DTN) configured with iPerf3 generated a sustained data rate of approximately 44 gigabits per second, over a period of 24 hours, exceeding the target of 40 gigabits per second.
