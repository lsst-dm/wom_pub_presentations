\vspace{-5.7cm}
\\That entails working with :
\begin{enumerate}
\item Chilean Operations to make sure the observations are scientifically good
\item the Data Facility to ensure production is running correctly
\item Survey performance to make sure over the longer period we will meet science goals.
\item EPO to communicate our successes {\bf and possible more importantly our short comings}.

\frame{\frametitle{Science Operations: Curating LSST Science }
On a daily basis Science Operations Staff are looking at data quality from both instrument and software perspectives asking many questions (28FTE):

\begin{itemize}
\item Are the alerts as good as we can make them ?
\item Are there any data products we could deliver/improve?
\item Are the changes we should request on the telescope ?
\item Was there some event (weather/hardware) affecting data we should be telling the community about ?

\end{itemize}
Longer term :
\begin{itemize}
\item Are there any disturbing trends in Key Performance Metrics?
\item How is the Data Release Product quality ?
\end{itemize}

5.5 FTE starting in Chile to learn the instrument and them migrating to Tucson\\
This group should:
\begin{itemize}
\item   Understand end-to-end impact of hardware and summit conditions on science
\item   Assure  science images can deliver to LSST’s science requirements
\item   Track and document hardware issues
\item   Propose changes to the telescope, instrumentation or software for efficiency

\end{itemize}
}



\frame{\frametitle{ Algorithms and Pipelines Group }
8 FTE in various institutes eventually converging on Tucson.
\begin{itemize}
\item   Tracking and documenting the data product quality for Alert Production using SDQA and other tools;
\item Proposing when changes need to be made to all aspects of the Alert Production algorithms and pipelines (including distribution of alerts and orbits for solar system objects);
\item Proposing when changes need to be made to all aspects of the annual data release algorithms (including calibration, Multifit, and deblender code); and
\item Proposing to accept or reject software changes based on a scientific validation of new algorithms and an understanding of their impact on required computational resources.

\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Science Platform }
4.5 FTE in Tucson
\begin{itemize}
\item  maintain and evolve the Science User Interface

\item maintain and evolve User Services

\end{itemize}
"Science Platform” refers to the functions that will enable the community to conduct analyses and generate new data products, near the data, and will include Jupyter widgets to enable users to use Jupyter notebook with SUI visualization and a set of special visualization templates for interactive Quality Analysis (QA).

\frame{\frametitle{DM Transition }
\begin{itemize}
\item DM --> Science Operations and LSST Data Facility
\item Starting to look at specific roles and the transition of DM staff into them
\item  As you see in the previous chart there will be a problem in commissioning to find enough FTEs
\item We may have to extend DM constructing further
\item A few DM people will  be in in Chile for some period of commissioning (Jim, Merlin, Robert \ldots)

\begin{itemize}
\item based on need to see the  hardware
\item  We are exploring this in the commissioning rehearsals
\item Most of us can work from our home institutes or perhaps congregate in Illinois or Tucson for specific events.
\end{itemize}
