\begin{itemize}
\item LSST Mini Broker - Users can create filters that return
\begin{itemize}
\item a subset of LSST alerts based only on data in the alert packet
\item  can use lightcurve, variability parameters, colors, etc.,
\item no crossmatch to external catalogs
\item Runs in the LSST Data Access Center(-> users must have data rights)
\end{itemize}

 \item Community Alert Brokers -  further enabling science on alerts {\em e.g.}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Provide public access to alerts
\item Classification and Crossmatch to other catalogs or data streams
\item Provide filtering, visualization, and search
\item Coordinate scientific activity and/or followup observations
\item Aggregate alert annotations (community classifications, etc.)
\end{itemize}

\item Call has gone out for community brokers
\item {\color{red}Mini Broker capacity/Number of community brokers  limited by bandwidth}
