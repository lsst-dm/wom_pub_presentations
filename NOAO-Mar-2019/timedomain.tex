LSST scans the sky repeatedly and compares the images with templates allowing us to:
\begin{itemize}
\item discover new, distant transient events
\item study variable objects in universe
\item capture rare and exotic objects
\item  gain new insight into known transients:
\begin{itemize}
\item  new remnants of dead massive stars, including neutron star and black hole binaries;
\item  variability at the heart of distant galaxies - feeding habits of the rapacious supermassive black holes at their centers;
\item  catch the faint cosmological explosions of dying, merging stars, illuminating where the universeâ€™s heavy metals are forged.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
