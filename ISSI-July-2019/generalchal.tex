Material  drawn from \cite{2019arXiv190505116B}\\
We have issues/challenges  :
\begin{itemize}

\item Data volume - data will be looking for astronomers not vice versa

	\begin{itemize}
	\item Should LSST be one of the last missions with proprietary data?
	\item Networks and infrastructure
	\item Commodity services ..
	\item Long term preservation
	\end{itemize}
\item Data models and interoperability
\item Long term software support and software eco system
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Open source and publicly scrutinized algorithms
	\item Agree community cyber infrastructure model
	\item Educate astronomers/managers on how to \emph{open source}
	\item Though I made my career in astronomy/computing .. its not easy .. and I really had to do the management thing

	\end{itemize}
\item Machine learning:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item  Automated discovery - need it great !
	\item Reproducibility, understand ability
	\end{itemize}
\item education - everyone needs to be a data scientist/programmer ..
\end{itemize}
