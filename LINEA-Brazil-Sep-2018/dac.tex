\end{itemize}
\item LSSTC (Corporation) considering International DACs

\begin{itemize}
\item International agencies interested in establishing international DACs (intDACs) -  potential added value to LSST science that
\begin{itemize}
\item May prefer national investments in local facilities  using funding programs targeting  infrastructure investments
\item Such national investments are not part of the scope of the LSST project and operations planning
\end{itemize}
\item Data access fees are a critical component of provisioning and funding LSST operations
\item Goal: need to structure an approach to intDACs in a way that is practical, seamless and beneficial to the full LSST science community while not undermining the operations funding
\begin{itemize}
\item LSSTC (D. MacFarlane) have setup a working group to consider criteria for intDAC
\end{itemize}
