\frame{\frametitle{Commissioning Start Requirements }

November 2019: DM for Commissioning (minimum required for start of commissioning with ComCam):
\hfill {\bf (See \citeds{LSE-79} \S 3.3 and table 8)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Pipeline: single-frame measurement including ISR, ghost masking, cosmic ray detection, PSF estimation, astrometric and photometric calibration, background estimation, single-frame deblending, master calibration image generation, atmospheric characterization
\item Services: archiving, EFD transformation, Data Backbone for files (Base/NCSA), telemetry gateway, OCS-controlled batch, offline processing
\item LSST Science Platform on Commissioning Cluster: Notebook Aspect, image access, user file storage, batch computing
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Milestones:}
\begin{itemize}
\item LDM-503-09\phantom{a} -- 2018-11-30: Demonstrate and rehearse commissioning capabilities
\item LDM-503-11a -- 2019-10-21: Verify that we are ready for commissioning ComCam

\end{itemize}

\frame{\frametitle{ Auxiliary Telescope (AuxTel)  }

{\color{red} Early  commissioning is coming soon!!!}
\begin{itemize}
\item Auxiliary Telescope is in Chile already --- the spectrograph will arrive after summer.
\item We plan to be taking and processing data early 2019!
\begin{itemize}
\item  Official operations late 2019 --- milestone LDM-503-08 in preparation for that.
\end{itemize}

\item We will have a pipeline for processing AuxTel data on the commissioning cluster.
\item Initially \emph{selected} data will be transferred to NCSA and made available in the Science Platform.
\item By summer 2019 we will have an automated processing system for AuxTel data.
\end{itemize}
