\frame { \frametitle{ Conclusion }
\begin{itemize}
	\item Current astronomical surveys are changing the way we do astronomy
\item Gaia is having a  huge impact on astronomy providing a statistically significant homogeneous data set - everywhere I go now I hear the Gaia reference frame in use
\item LSST will soon follow perhaps ushering a complete change in how we approach end user data interaction
\item Science missions are a mixture of innovative hardware, scientific algorithms, software and people
\item Looking forward to the first LSST images !
\end{itemize}
