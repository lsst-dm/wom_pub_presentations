\item All source available \url{https://github.com/lsst-sqre/jupyterlabdemo}
\item Deploy on your  own K8s cluster  \url{https://github.com/lsst-sqre/jupyterlabdemo/tree/master/tools/deployment}
\item Versions with Stack 14 available for trial during the workshop \url{https://jupyter.nlhpc.cl/lsst/hub/home}
