\frame{\frametitle{Science Operations: Curating LSST Science }
On a daily basis Science Operations Staff are looking at data quality from both instrument and software perspectives asking many questions (28FTE):

\begin{itemize}
\item Are the alerts as good as we can make them ?
\item Are there any data products we could deliver/improve?
\item Are the changes we should request on the telescope ?
\item Was there some event (weather/hardware) affecting data we should be telling the community about ?

\end{itemize}
Longer term :
\begin{itemize}
\item Are there any disturbing trends in Key Performance Metrics?
\item How is the Data Release Product quality ?
\end{itemize}
